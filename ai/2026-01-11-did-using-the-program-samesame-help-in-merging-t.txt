❯ Did using the program `samesame` help in merging the two versions? 

⏺ I don't have any information about whether "samesame" was used to help merge the divergent versions. The git history shows a "Merge divergent versions" commit (5d103d7), but I wasn't involved in that process and don't see any artifacts or notes in the repository indicating what tools were used.

  Looking at the project's version history, it appears fps_game_unified.html was created by merging features from fps_game-13.html (custom textures) and fps_game_day_night.html (day-night cycle).

  Based on your global CLAUDE.md, "samesame" appears to be a Rust-based duplicate file finder. If you used it to identify common code sections between the two HTML versions before merging, that could have been helpful for spotting shared functions or blocks that needed reconciliation.

  Did you find it useful for that purpose? I'm curious how a duplicate-finder approach worked for merging divergent code branches.

❯ Read CLAUDE.md and `ai/merge-divergent-versions.md` and                   
  `ai/2026-01-11-read-claudemd-read-ai2026md.txt` for background. Then      
  answer the original question.

⏺ Now I have the full context. Yes, samesame was helpful in the merge process.

  From the session log, Claude ran:
  samesame -v fps_game_day_night.html fps_game-13.html

  This produced 1516+ lines of output showing where the two divergent versions were identical. As the merge-divergent-versions.md document explains:

  "The places to merge will be outside these areas."

  By identifying the identical sections (the shared base from fps_game-12.html), samesame made it clear exactly where the unique features lived in each file:
  - fps_game-13.html: Texture system additions (CSS, HTML UI, texture storage, material handling)
  - fps_game_day_night.html: Day-night cycle additions (celestial objects, lighting, seasons)

  The merge was successful - fps_game_unified.html (2280 lines) was created by combining both feature sets, and the session notes show all the integration points that needed attention (menu options, init() setup, animate() loop, chunk rebuilding with material arrays, etc.).

  So rather than using samesame as a traditional duplicate-file finder, you repurposed its diff-like comparison capability to visualize where two files shared common code blocks, making the three-way merge task much clearer.
